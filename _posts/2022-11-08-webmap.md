title: Making Web Map using LeafletJS
---

As you all know, I am a really curious person, always scavenging the internet to learn something new about the world of tech. Lately, I have been really curious about maps on the internet, I wondered how Google or Bing create these types of maps that millions if not billions of people use every month. I wanted to learn a way to introduce myself to understand how to make web apps, without having previous knowledge of GIS (geographic information system), using a special type of `JavaScript` library called `LeafletJS`.

`LeafletJS` is an open-sourced JS library that is used to make and build web mapping applications. This library allows developers to make tiled web maps without knowing GIS, you only need knowledge of `HTML`, `CSS`, and of course, `JavaScript`! Some major companies and businesses trust `Leaflet`. Some include:

- [FourSquare](https://foursquare.com/)
- [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/)
- [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)

So without a further ado...let's get started!

## Installation

To get started making these web maps, we always gotta start installing all of the important necessities for the project. There are three ways to install the library:

### If you have `npm` installed:

```bash
npm install leaflet
```

You will find a copy of the Leaflet release files in `node_modules/leaflet/dist`.

### Install the package

If not, install this [package](https://leafletjs-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/leaflet/v1.9.2/leaflet.zip), unzip it, and follow the instructions on this [website](https://leafletjs.com/download.html).

### Clone the reposittory

You can also clone the `Leaflet` repo from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.git
cd Leaflet
```

## Making the Web Map

In order to make the map, I first created an `HTML` file called `index.html` which first contained this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.2/dist/leaflet.css" integrity="sha256-sA+zWATbFveLLNqWO2gtiw3HL/lh1giY/Inf1BJ0z14=" crossorigin="" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.2/dist/leaflet.js" integrity="sha256-o9N1jGDZrf5tS+Ft4gbIK7mYMipq9lqpVJ91xHSyKhg=" crossorigin=""></script>
```

This here just imports the JS and `CSS` files that we previously installed. Note that it is important to have written the stylesheet one **FIRST** before writing the script.

Then once I did all of that, I add a bit of personal styling, mainly for the size of the map:

```css
#map {
    height: 600px;
}
```

Once after that, I began the most important step...bring the map to life!

This step was a bit complicated for me at first, but at the end, it was all worth it! I began by typing `<script>` in the same file, and wrote out this:

```js
var map = L.map('map').setView([38.91, -77.03], 13);
L.tileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    maxZoom: 19,
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>'
}).addTo(map);
```

The variable `map` is the actual map itself, where I input the coordinates for Washington D.C. This program also uses [`openstreetmap.org`](openstreetmap.org) to display the map. The second line is where I added that `tileLayer` from `openstreetmap.org`, placed a max zoom, and made attribution to `openstreetmap`. With all of this, it gets added to the map itself.

## Results and Conclusion

The result that I got was this:

<img class = "mx-auto w-1/2" src = "{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/webappresult.png">

At first, I was pleased with the results. It was straightforward with a bit of help from documentation and people on Stack Overflow (of course), but I think I could add a bit more things to it that would make it ultimate:

- Adding satellite view
- Allow the user to click at a specific point to find the coordiantes
- Street View (I could use Google's or Bing's API)
- Directions

In the past, I made some maps similar to this, but it involved R since I was dealing with statistics. This was more of an experiment to play around with this library.
