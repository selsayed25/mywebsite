Hello and welcome to the new and improved version of my website! This website is a move from the old static website of before, to the new and dynamic website of <a href = "https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. I'm using <a href = "https://github.com/harrywang/tailpages">Harry Wang's Tailpages</a> to be able to run this website using GitHub pages, which is known for not being able to run dynamic frameworks like <a href = "https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href = "https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.0/">Flask</a>, and others. 

I welcome you to explore this website and if you have any feedback or questions, don't hesitate to email at <a href = "mailto:2025selsayed@tjhsst.edu">2025selsayed@tjhsst.edu</a>.
